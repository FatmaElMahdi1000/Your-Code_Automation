This script provides a better alternative to using BCC for mass email campaigns. 
While BCC is a quick way to send an email to many people at once, it creates a single, non-personalizable email thread for all recipients. This can be confusing and lacks a personal touch.

This program is designed to solve these issues by:

-Creating Individualized Drafts: Instead of a single email sent to multiple recipients, the script generates a separate draft for each email address. This ensures that you have a unique, clean email for every recipient.

-Personalizing the Subject Line: The script automatically includes the recipient's name in the subject line (e.g., "John | Confirming Your Payment Method!"). This makes each email feel more direct and tailored to the individual.

-Adding a Personal Salutation: The code finds common salutations like "Hello" or "Dear" in the body of the email and inserts the recipient's name (e.g., "Hello John"). If no salutation is found, it automatically adds "Dear [Vendor Name]". This small but impactful change makes the correspondence feel much more personal.
